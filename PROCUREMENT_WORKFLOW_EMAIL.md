Subject: SCIS Envisioned Procurement Workflow (R2P) — For Review and Feedback

Dear Team,

Please find below the envisioned end-to-end Requisition-to-Payment (R2P) workflow we are looking to implement for SCIS. This is drawn from the SCIS Procurement & Inventory Management Policy & Procedure and outlines how the system should handle a purchase from the initial request through to supplier payment.

We would like your feedback on whether this workflow is practical to build, whether any steps are missing or unclear, and whether the controls and approval structure align with how you see the system being used.

"To Advance Our Educational Mission While Stewarding Every Shilling and Safeguarding Every Learner."


THE EIGHT-STEP R2P PROCESS

Every purchase would go through these eight steps in order:

  01. Requisition       →  02. Budget         →  03. Sourcing / Evaluation
  04. Award / PO        →  05. Delivery / GRN  →  06. Acceptance
  07. 3-Way Match       →  08. Payment


STEP 01 — REQUISITION

The requester raises a Purchase Requisition (PR) in the system with clear specifications, quantities, required delivery date, and the relevant budget line. The request cannot proceed without all of these fields completed.


STEP 02 — BUDGET

The Head of Department, Procurement Manager, and Chief Accountant verify that funding is available and authorize the need. The system ring-fences (commits) the budget at this point so it cannot be used elsewhere.

  Available Budget = Allocated Amount - Already Committed - Already Spent

If there is insufficient budget, the request is blocked.


STEP 03 — SOURCING AND SUPPLIER EVALUATION

The Procurement Manager goes to market. The sourcing method and level of competition required depend on the value of the purchase (see Cash Bands below).

Supplier evaluation is carried out by a cross-functional panel. All panel members must declare any conflict of interest before participating and are excluded if a conflict exists. Only suppliers on the Approved Supplier List (ASL) may be awarded — new suppliers must complete a Supplier Onboarding Pack (including KRA/eTIMS readiness and bank verification) before a first award.


STEP 04 — AWARD AND PURCHASE ORDER

The best-value, compliant supplier is selected and a formal Purchase Order (PO) or Contract is issued. The PO sets out quantity, quality, price, warranty, and all standard terms. This is SCIS's legal commitment to buy.


STEP 05 — DELIVERY AND GOODS RECEIVED NOTE (GRN)

Goods or services are delivered to the school store. The Stores Manager inspects the delivery and raises a Goods Received Note (GRN) recording what was actually received — quantity, condition, serial/batch numbers, and expiry dates where applicable.


STEP 06 — ACCEPTANCE

The end-user department confirms that the items are fit for purpose and signs off on quality. For services or works, a completion certificate is required.


STEP 07 — 3-WAY MATCH

The Procurement Manager and the Chief Accountant perform a final validation check across all three documents:

  Purchase Order  <-->  Goods Received Note  <-->  Supplier Invoice (eTIMS compliant)

All three must align. If they match, payment proceeds. If they do not match, payment is automatically blocked and a mandatory root-cause analysis is triggered.

Note: The supplier invoice must carry a valid KRA eTIMS fiscal control number. Invoices without one will be returned to the supplier.


STEP 08 — PAYMENT

Payment is released through a mandatory 3-step PesaPal authorization:

  Maker    — Chief Accountant initiates payment only after full compliance is confirmed
  Checker  — Procurement Manager independently verifies the payee, amount, and documents
  Approver — Director approves the release of funds

The PesaPal reference is recorded and reconciled to bank statements. Where Withholding Tax (WHT) applies, it is automatically deducted and remitted to KRA, and a WHT certificate is issued to the supplier.


CASH BAND THRESHOLDS AND APPROVAL LEVELS

The sourcing method and approvals required depend on the total purchase value:

  Micro    Up to KES 50,000          Spot buy; 1 written quote          HoD + PM + CA
  Low      50,001 - 250,000          Request for Quotation (RFQ);       HoD + PM + CA + BoD
                                     min. 3 written quotes               (where necessary)
  Medium   250,001 - 1,000,000       Formal RFQ; min. 3 responsive      PM + CA + BoD
                                     bids; weighted evaluation
  High     1,000,001 - 5,000,000     Request for Proposal / Tender;     BoD
                                     panel; technical & commercial
                                     due diligence
  Strategic  Above 5,000,000         Request for Proposal / Tender;     BoD
                                     panel; due diligence; contract
                                     review

Key: HoD = Head of Department, PM = Procurement Manager, CA = Chief Accountant, BoD = Board of Directors


KEY CONTROLS BUILT INTO THE WORKFLOW

  1. Segregation of duties — Responsibilities are split across the lifecycle:
     Request > Budget > Source > Receive > Pay > Audit. No single person
     controls more than one of these stages for the same transaction.

  2. No PO, No Pay — Payment cannot be initiated without a valid, approved PO.

  3. No GRN, No Pay — Payment cannot be released without a completed and
     accepted Goods Received Note.

  4. No eTIMS, No Pay — Supplier invoices without a valid KRA eTIMS control
     number are returned; payment is blocked until a compliant invoice is received.

  5. 3-Way Match enforcement — The system automatically blocks payment if the
     PO, GRN, and invoice do not align.

  6. Immutable audit trail — Every action is logged automatically and cannot be
     altered. Records are retained for seven years.

  7. Conflict of interest controls — Panel members with a connection to a supplier
     must declare it and are excluded from that evaluation.


EXCEPTIONS

  Emergency        Compressed approvals permitted for safeguarding or continuity
                   reasons. A full post-event file must be completed within 2
                   business days. No exception bypasses the audit trail.

  Single/Sole      Permitted with written justification and approvals per the
  Source           Delegation of Authority. Must be documented and reported.

All exceptions are logged, reported to leadership, and reviewed — they are never used to bypass controls.


IN SUMMARY

A requester raises a need with a clear budget line → the Chief Accountant and Procurement Manager confirm funding and authorize sourcing → a compliant supplier is selected through fair, documented evaluation → goods are delivered, inspected, and accepted → the 3-Way Match is performed → payment is released through the PesaPal 3-step authorization — and every step is permanently recorded.

Please share any questions, concerns, or suggested changes at your earliest convenience.
