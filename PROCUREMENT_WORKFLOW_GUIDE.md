# How a Purchase Request Works — From Idea to Payment

A plain-language guide for staff, heads of department, and school management.

---

## The Big Picture

Whenever the school needs to buy something, it follows a controlled process to make sure:

- The right people approve the spend
- The school doesn't overspend its budget
- The best value supplier is chosen fairly
- Goods are actually received before anyone gets paid
- Every step is recorded and cannot be tampered with

The process has **four stages**:

```
1. REQUISITION  →  2. PURCHASE ORDER  →  3. GOODS RECEIPT  →  4. PAYMENT
   (Request)           (Formal Order)        (Delivery Check)     (Pay Supplier)
```

## Stage 1 — The Purchase Request (Requisition)

**Who starts it:** Any member of staff

**What happens:** A staff member identifies something the school needs to buy — stationery, equipment, a service, etc. — and raises a formal request in the system.

---

### Step-by-step

**Step 1 — Draft**
The staff member fills in a form: what they want to buy, why they need it, how many, and the estimated cost. The request is saved as a draft and can be edited freely.

**Step 2 — Submitted**
Once happy with the request, the staff member clicks "Submit." The request is now locked for editing and moves to the approver's inbox.

**Step 3 & 4 — HOD Review and Approval**
The Head of Department reviews the request. They check whether the purchase is genuinely needed and makes sense for the department.

- If they agree → they approve it.
- If not → they reject it with a reason. The staff member can correct and resubmit.

> For purchases **up to KES 50,000**, the HOD is the final approver at this stage.

**Step 5 & 6 — Budget Check and Approval**
The finance team checks whether the department actually has money available in its budget for this purchase. The system automatically checks:

> *Available Budget = Allocated Amount − Already Committed − Already Spent*

If the money is there, it is **ring-fenced** (set aside) for this request so it can't be accidentally used for something else. If there isn't enough money, the request is blocked.

**Step 7 — Procurement Queue**
The request is handed to the Procurement Officer. It now sits in a queue ready to find a supplier.

**Step 8 — Sourcing**
The Procurement Officer goes out to the market to find suppliers. They prepare a **Request for Quotation (RFQ)** and send it out.

> By law, at least **3 quotations** are required unless there is a justified reason to use a single supplier.

**Step 9 — Quoted**
Supplier quotes/bids come back in.

**Step 10 — Evaluated**
An evaluation committee scores the bids fairly — on price, quality, delivery time, and compliance. Committee members must declare any conflict of interest (e.g. a family connection to a supplier) and are excluded if a conflict exists.

**Step 11 — Awarded**
The best supplier is chosen and the award is approved:

| Purchase Amount | Who Must Approve |
|---|---|
| Up to KES 200,000 | Executive Head |
| Above KES 1,000,000 | Board |

**Step 12 — Purchase Order Created**
A formal Purchase Order (PO) is generated and sent to the winning supplier. This is the school's official commitment to buy.

**Step 13 — Requisition Completed**
The requisition is closed. The process moves to Stage 2.

---

## Stage 2 — The Purchase Order (PO)

**Who manages it:** Procurement Officer and Finance

**What it is:** The official document that tells the supplier exactly what to deliver, at what price, and by when.

The PO goes through its own approvals:

1. Drafted by the Procurement Officer
2. Approved by the Executive Head or Finance Manager
3. Issued (sent) to the supplier
4. The supplier acknowledges receipt
5. Goods are delivered and received (Stage 3 happens here)
6. The supplier sends their invoice
7. The invoice is matched to the PO
8. Finance approves for payment
9. Payment is made
10. PO is closed

---

## Stage 3 — Receiving the Goods (GRN)

**Who manages it:** Stores Manager and Quality Officer

**What it is:** A Goods Received Note (GRN) — a record that confirms the school actually received what was ordered.

**Why it matters:** The school will not pay for goods it hasn't received. This step prevents fraud and billing errors.

**What happens:**

1. Goods arrive at the school stores
2. The Stores Manager creates a GRN recording what arrived
3. A Quality Officer inspects the goods — checking quantity, condition, and whether they match the order
4. If everything is fine → the GRN is approved and stock levels are updated automatically
5. If goods are partially acceptable → a partial acceptance is recorded
6. If goods fail inspection → they are rejected and returned to the supplier

---

## Stage 4 — Paying the Supplier

**Who manages it:** Accountant, Senior Accountant, Finance Manager

**What it is:** The actual transfer of money to the supplier.

Before any payment is made, the system automatically performs a **three-way check**:

> Purchase Order amount ↔ Goods Received Note quantity ↔ Supplier Invoice amount

All three must match within a **2% tolerance**. If they don't, payment is blocked until the discrepancy is resolved.

---

### Step-by-step

**Step 1 — Payment Created (Draft)**
The Accountant creates a payment record linked to the approved invoice(s). The system automatically calculates any **tax deductions (WHT)**:

| Type of Payment | Tax Deducted at Source |
|---|---|
| Services | 5% |
| Professional Fees | 5% |
| Management Fees | 2% |
| Training | 5% |
| Rent | 10% |

The supplier receives the **net amount** (after tax). The school remits the deducted tax directly to KRA.

**Step 2 — Submitted for Verification**
The Accountant submits the payment for review.

**Step 3 & 4 — Verification**
A **different person** (Senior Accountant) reviews and verifies the payment details — amounts, bank account, supplier details. The same person who prepared the payment cannot verify it.

**Step 5 — eTIMS Check**
The system checks that every invoice being paid has a valid **KRA eTIMS control number** — a digital stamp from Kenya Revenue Authority confirming the invoice is genuine and tax-compliant. Without this, payment cannot proceed.

**Step 6 — Approved**
The Finance Manager gives final approval. Again, this must be a **different person** from the preparer and verifier.

**Step 7 — Payment Processing**
The actual bank transfer or cheque is issued to the supplier.

**Step 8 — Paid**
The system marks the invoices as paid and automatically generates a **Withholding Tax Certificate** for the supplier (if WHT was deducted). This certificate is the supplier's proof of tax paid on their behalf.

**Step 9 — Completed**
The budget is updated — the ring-fenced (committed) amount is moved to "spent." The full procurement cycle is closed.

## The "No, You Can't Do That" Rules

The system enforces these rules automatically and cannot be overridden:

### 1. No One Person Can Do Everything
The same person cannot raise a request AND approve it AND choose the supplier AND receive the goods AND process the payment. These roles are separated by design to prevent fraud.

### 2. No Overspending
If a department doesn't have enough budget, the request is blocked at Step 6. The Executive Head or Finance Manager must approve any exceptions.

### 3. No Payment Without Delivery
You cannot pay a supplier unless a GRN has been completed and approved confirming delivery.

### 4. Everything Is Recorded Forever
Every action — who approved what, when, and any comments — is logged automatically and **cannot be deleted or altered**. These records are kept for **7 years** as required by law.

### 5. Conflicts of Interest Are Blocked
If a committee member has a connection to a supplier being evaluated, they are automatically excluded from that evaluation.

## What Happens If Something Goes Wrong

| Situation | What Happens |
|---|---|
| Request is rejected | Staff member is notified with a reason; they can correct and resubmit |
| Not enough budget | Request is blocked; finance team is notified |
| Goods fail inspection | Goods returned to supplier; PO may be amended |
| Invoice doesn't match PO | Payment blocked until resolved |
| Payment processing fails | The payment can be resubmitted for approval and retried |
| Emergency purchase needed | A fast-track process is available up to KES 100,000, but requires retrospective approval and is fully audited |

---

## Quick Reference: Approval Limits

| Amount | Approver Required |
|---|---|
| Up to KES 50,000 | Head of Department |
| KES 50,001 – KES 200,000 | Executive Head |
| Above KES 1,000,000 | Board |
| Above KES 500,000 | Full tender process required |

---

## Summary in One Sentence

> A staff member raises a need → management checks it's justified and affordable → procurement finds the best supplier → goods are delivered and inspected → finance pays the supplier only after confirming everything matches — and every step is permanently recorded.
